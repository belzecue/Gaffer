This is the Git repository for [Gaffer], the Blender Add-on for speeding up your lighting workflow.

You can download it here to try it out. If you like it, please consider [purchasing it from the Blender Market]. $20 isn't much, and every sale puts a smile on my face and motivates me to keep developing it :)

A portion of every sale is donated to the [Blender Development Fund] too.

Documentation can be found in [the wiki], and a list of changes in the [commit logs] or on the [Releases page].

# Download and install

[Download the Trial](http://bit.ly/gaf-trial-dl)

This is identical to the paid product, just with a small "Trial version" text in some places. There are no time limits, nagging popups, or any restrictions.

If you later choose to [purchase Gaffer](https://blendermarket.com/products/gaffer-light-manager) to support its development, as well as the work we do on [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com), simply uninstall the Trial version and install the version you purchased.

If you download this Git repository instead of the trial linked above, you'll need to manually install it by unzipping and placing the files in the correct location.
